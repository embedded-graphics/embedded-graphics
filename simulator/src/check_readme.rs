// simulator. These examples are tested here because it's currently impossible
// to add a dev-dependency to the simulator without breaking no_std builds.
//
// This test can be moved back into the embedded-graphics crate when
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#features
// gets stabilized.
