//! # Embedded graphics
//!
//! This crate aims to make drawing 2D graphics primitives super easy. It currently supports the
//! following:
//!
//! * 1 bit-per-pixel images
//! * 8 bit-per-pixel images (downsampled to 1BPP currently)
//! * Primitives
//!     * Lines
//!     * Rectangles (and squares)
//!     * Circles
//! * Text with a 6x8 pixel font
//!
//! A core goal is to do the above without using any buffers; the crate should work without a
//! dynamic memory allocator and without pre-allocating large chunks of memory. To achieve this, it
//! takes an `Iterator` based approach, where pixel values and positions are calculated on the fly,
//! with the minimum of saved state. This allows the consuming application to use far less RAM at
//! little to no performance penalty.
//!
//! To use this crate in a driver, you only need to implement the `Drawing` trait to start drawing
//! things.
//!
//! You can also add your own objects by implementing `IntoIterator<Item = Pixel>` to create an
//! iterator that `Drawable#draw()` can consume.
